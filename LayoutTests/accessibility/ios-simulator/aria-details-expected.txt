Details example
The Pythagorean Theorem is a relationship in Euclidean Geometry between the three sides of a right triangle, where the square of the hypotenuse is the sum of the squares of the two opposing sides.

The following drawing illustrates an application of the Pythagorean Theorem when used to construct a skateboard ramp.

In this example you will notice a skateboard ramp with a base and vertical board whose width is the width of the ramp. To compute how long the ramp must be, simply calculate the base length, square it, sum it with the square of the height of the ramp, and take the square root of the sum.
