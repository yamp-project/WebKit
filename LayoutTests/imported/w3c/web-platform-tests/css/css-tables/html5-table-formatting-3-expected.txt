HTML5 Table Formatting algorithm (row/column grid computation)

Verifies how browsers deal with implicit tracks from which no cell does originate

This should be a 100px by 100px blue square:
The table grid is 1x1, so the table is not empty and follows step 3A of the table layout algorithm (which adds anonymous cell boxes)

The consecutive tracks were merged together because they are not all defined explicitely by a table-column or a table-row, and share the same set of cells

Two 25px border-spacing causes the addition of 50px (track is 50x50)

This should be a 100px by 100px blue square:

Two 25px border-spacing causes the addition of 50px (track is 50x50)

This should be a 75px by 75px blue square:
The table grid is 2x2, so the table is not empty and follows step 3A of the table layout algorithm (which adds anonymous cell boxes)

The consecutive tracks were not merged together because they are all defined explicitely by a table-column or a table-row

Three 25px border-spacing causes the addition of 75px (tracks are 0x0)

The consecutive tracks were not merged together because they are all defined explicitely by a table-column or a table-row

Three 25px border-spacing causes the addition of 75px (tracks are 12.5x12.5)


PASS Control test for table-cell padding and border-spacing, etc (width)
PASS Control test for table-cell padding and border-spacing (height)
PASS Anonymous consecutive columns spanned by the same set of cells are merged
PASS Anonymous consecutive rows spanned by the same set of cells are merged
FAIL Explicitely-defined consecutive columns spanned by the same set of cells are not merged assert_equals: expected 75 but got 50
PASS Explicitely-defined consecutive rows spanned by the same set of cells are not merged
FAIL Explicitely-defined consecutive columns spanned by the same set of cells are not merged, and cells span across border-spacing assert_equals: expected 12.5 but got 0
FAIL Explicitely-defined consecutive rows spanned by the same set of cells are not merged, and cells span across border-spacing assert_equals: expected 12.5 but got 50
