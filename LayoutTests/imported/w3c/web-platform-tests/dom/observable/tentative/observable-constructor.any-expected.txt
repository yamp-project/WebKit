PASS Observable constructor
PASS subscribe() can be called with no arguments
PASS Subscriber interface is not constructible
PASS Subscribe with just a function as the next handler
PASS Observable constructor calls initializer on subscribe
PASS Observable error path called synchronously
PASS Subscriber must have receiver
PASS Subscriber next & error must recieve argument
PASS Subscriber complete() will set active to false, and abort signal
PASS Subscriber active is readonly
PASS Subscriber signal is readonly
PASS Observable should error if initializer throws
PASS Subscription is inactive after complete()
PASS Subscription is inactive after error()
PASS Subscription is inactive when aborted signal is passed in
PASS Subscriber#signal is not the same AbortSignal as the one passed into `subscribe()`
PASS Subscription does not emit values after completion
PASS Subscription does not emit values after error
PASS Completing or nexting a subscriber after an error does nothing
PASS Errors pushed to the subscriber that are not handled by the subscription are reported to the global
PASS Errors thrown in the initializer that are not handled by the subscription are reported to the global
PASS Subscription reports errors that are pushed after subscriber is closed by completion
PASS Errors thrown by initializer function after subscriber is closed by completion are reported
PASS Errors thrown by initializer function after subscriber is closed by error are reported
PASS Errors pushed by initializer function after subscriber is closed by error are reported
PASS Subscriber#complete() cannot re-entrantly invoke itself
PASS Subscriber#error() cannot re-entrantly invoke itself
PASS Unsubscription lifecycle
PASS Teardowns are called in upstream->downstream order on consumer-initiated unsubscription
PASS Teardowns are called in downstream->upstream order on consumer-initiated unsubscription with pre-aborted Signal
PASS Producer-initiated unsubscription in a downstream Observable fires abort events before each teardown, in downstream->upstream order
PASS Subscriber#error() value is stored as Subscriber's AbortSignal's reason
PASS Aborting a subscription should stop emitting values
PASS Calling subscribe should never throw an error synchronously, initializer throws error
PASS Calling subscribe should never throw an error synchronously, subscriber pushes error
PASS Teardown should be called when subscription is aborted
PASS Teardowns should be called when subscription is closed by completion
PASS Teardowns should be called when subscription is closed by subscriber pushing an error
PASS Teardowns should be called when subscription is closed by subscriber throwing error
PASS Teardowns should be called synchronously during addTeardown() if the subscription is inactive
FAIL Multiple subscriptions share the same producer and teardown runs only after last subscription abort assert_equals: Producer should not be invoked again for second subscription expected 1 but got 2
FAIL New subscription after complete creates new producer assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array ["producer start", "teardown"] length 2, got ["producer start", "producer start", "teardown"] length 3
FAIL Teardown runs after last unsubscribe regardless of unsubscription order assert_equals: Producer should be invoked once expected 1 but got 3
