 assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array ["cycle-tdz-access-a", object "ReferenceError: Cannot access 'Y' before initialization.", "load", [...], "load", [...], "load"] length 7, got ["cycle-tdz-access-a", object "ReferenceError: Cannot access 'Y' before initialization.", "load", "load", "load"] length 5
