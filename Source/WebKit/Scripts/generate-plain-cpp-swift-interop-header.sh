# Swift/C++ interop generates a header file to be included in C++ code that provides
# definitions of types encountered in Swift.
# There's built-in Xcode functionality to generate this file.
# But we need to do it twice:
# - once, processing Swift code that pertains to objective-C[++] types to generate
#   a header for inclusion in objective-C++ code
# - once, processing only Swift code that does not involve objective-C[++] types,
#   to generate a header which can be safely included in pure C++ code.
# This shell script does the second thing. We use the built-in XCode action
# for the first.
# Working around:
# - rdar://152836730
# - rdar://158843666
# We will be able to remove this script entirely once these issues are fixed.
# Known deficiencies in thie script:
# - We do not attempt to provide all the #defines normally provided to C++ nor
#   the -Ds to Swift.
# - We do not provide a full include path.
# - There is no attempt at full dependency tracking (.d files etc.)
# This is mostly OK because right now the only header file included from Swift
# refers to only one other header.
